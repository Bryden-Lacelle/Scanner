Written Functions: err_VID_LEN_atrbt(), errSymbol(), runError(), errorString(), copyString(), getString(), aa_func12()
For this assignment I implimented the above functions for handling strings, error tokens, and run time errors. In addition 
I implimented the cases for handling '=' and '.' characters as well as the handling of comments and strings. Code that 
manipulates lex_buf in mlwpar_next_token() was written by me. I was responsible for debugging all functions and code 
outlined above.
